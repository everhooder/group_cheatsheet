<h2> hi all!</h2>
<h3> my weekend is going great, thanks - visiting some friends in the south of France :) </h3>
<h3>what about yours?</h3>

<h3> so this is my modest contribution for today: </h3>

<h2> Commands in Git </h2>
<h3> git init : To initialize a git repository in a new or an existing project </h3>
<h3> git clone : To copy a git repository </h3>
<h3> git add --all : To add all the changes to be committed</h3>
<h3> git commit -m : To commit the files that have been added, creates a new revision with a log </h3>
<h3> git push : To push your changes to the remote directory </h3>
<h3> git pull : To take the files from the remote directory and merge them with the local one </h3>
<h3> git log : To show a list of commits on a branch with the details </h3>

<p> Heya! </p>
<p> I have a London weekend: got some beers with some friends of mine in Camden town; having a "Ruby" day today and tomorrow I am at Wireless festival.</p>
