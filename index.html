<h2> hi all!</h2>

<h3>what about yours?</h3>

<h3> so this is my modest contribution for today: </h3>

<h2> Commands in Git </h2>
<ul>
    <li> git init : To initialize a git repository in a new or an existing project </li>
    <li> git clone : To copy a git repository </li>
    <li> git add --all : To add all the changes to be committed</li>
    <li> git commit -m : To commit the files that have been added, creates a new revision with a log </li>
    <li> git push : To push your changes to the remote directory </li>
    <li> git pull : To take the files from the remote directory and merge them with the local one </li>
    <li> git log : To show a list of commits on a branch with the details </li
</ul>

<h3> Cheers, Annabelle </h2>
